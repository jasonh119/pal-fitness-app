# User Story: 19 - Track Elevation Data

**As a** runner or cyclist,
**I want** the app to capture and display elevation changes during my activities,
**so that** I can understand the difficulty of my routes and track my performance on hills.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Elevation data is captured throughout the activity using GPS altitude data
* Elevation profile is displayed as a chart showing climbs and descents
* Total elevation gain and loss are calculated and displayed
* Elevation data is stored with route information for historical comparison
* Visual indicators show steep climbs and descents on the route map

## Notes

* Elevation tracking is particularly important for cycling and trail running
* Helps users understand route difficulty and training intensity
* Can be used for route comparison and performance analysis
