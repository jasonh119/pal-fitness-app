# User Story: 21 - Import and Export Fitness Data

**As a** fitness enthusiast who values data portability and backup,
**I want** to import and export my fitness targets, achievements, and progress data,
**so that** I can backup my data, migrate between devices, or share my fitness journey with others.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Export Functionality
* User can export all fitness targets to a JSON file
* User can export achievement history and progress data
* User can choose to export specific date ranges or target types
* Export includes all relevant metadata (creation dates, completion dates, progress history)
* Export file is human-readable and structured
* User can download the export file with a meaningful filename (e.g., "pal-fitness-backup-2025-10-01.json")

### Import Functionality
* User can import previously exported fitness data
* System validates imported data structure and integrity
* User can choose to merge imported data with existing data or replace existing data
* System handles duplicate targets gracefully (with user confirmation)
* Import errors are clearly displayed with specific guidance
* User can preview imported data before confirming the import

### Data Portability
* Export format is standardized and version-controlled
* System maintains backward compatibility with older export formats
* Data can be exported in multiple formats (JSON, CSV for spreadsheet compatibility)
* User can export individual target progress as CSV for analysis

### User Experience
* Export/Import functionality is accessible from the main targets dashboard
* Clear progress indicators during import/export operations
* Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations (data replacement)
* Success/failure notifications with actionable next steps

## Technical Requirements

### Export Data Structure
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "exportDate": "2025-10-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "exportedBy": "PAL Fitness App v1.0",
  "data": {
    "targets": [
      {
        "id": "target-123",
        "type": "distance",
        "period": "weekly",
        "targetValue": 50,
        "currentValue": 32.5,
        "unit": "km",
        "status": "active",
        "startDate": "2025-09-30T00:00:00.000Z",
        "endDate": "2025-10-06T23:59:59.999Z",
        "createdAt": "2025-09-30T10:00:00.000Z",
        "completedAt": null,
        "progressHistory": [
          {
            "date": "2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z",
            "value": 10.5
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "achievements": [
      {
        "id": "achievement-123",
        "targetId": "target-123",
        "achievedAt": "2025-09-25T10:00:00.000Z",
        "type": "distance",
        "value": 50,
        "celebrated": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### File Operations
* Client-side file generation and download
* File input handling with drag-and-drop support
* File validation and error handling
* Progress tracking for large data imports

## Priority: Medium

## Story Points: 8

## Dependencies
* Requires GPS-005 (Set and Track Fitness Targets) to be completed
* Should integrate with existing target management system
* May benefit from GPS-017 (Manage Privacy and Data Sharing) for privacy controls

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
* Export/Import buttons prominently placed but not intrusive
* Modal dialogs for import/export configuration
* Progress bars for long-running operations
* Clear error states and recovery instructions
* Confirmation steps for data-destructive operations

### Data Validation
* JSON schema validation for imports
* Date format validation and conversion
* Duplicate detection and resolution
* Data integrity checks (target references, achievement consistency)

### Security & Privacy
* No sensitive data included in exports (unless explicitly requested)
* Option to anonymize exported data
* Clear indication of what data is being exported
* Secure handling of imported files (no script execution)

## Testing Requirements
* Unit tests for data serialization/deserialization
* Integration tests for file operations
* Edge case testing (corrupted files, large datasets)
* Cross-browser compatibility testing for file operations

## Future Enhancements
* Cloud backup integration (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox)
* Automatic backup scheduling
* Data synchronization across devices
* Integration with popular fitness platforms (Strava, Garmin Connect)
* Export to fitness data standards (TCX, FIT, GPX for applicable data)

## Notes
* Consider implementing incremental exports for users with large datasets
* Provide clear documentation on export format for developers
* Consider compression for large export files
* Implement export/import analytics to understand usage patterns
