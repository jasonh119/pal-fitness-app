# User Story: 18 - Access Multi-Platform Interface

**As a** user with multiple devices,

**so that** I can view and manage my fitness data regardless of which device I'm using.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Mobile-optimized interface for phones and tablets
* Desktop interface for larger screens with enhanced data visualization
* Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
* Data synchronization across all platforms and devices

## Notes

* Cross-platform compatibility is essential for user convenience
* Different interfaces may emphasize different features (mobile for live tracking, desktop for analysis)
* Web-based approach avoids platform-specific development requirements
