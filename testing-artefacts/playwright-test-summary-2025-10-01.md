## Issues & Observations

### Minor Issues
None critical. Application performed as expected.

### Observations
1. Fast Refresh is working correctly in development mode
2. Console shows multiple target fetching calls - might be optimizable but doesn't affect functionality
3. Image optimization warnings from Next.js for logo images - non-critical
4. Radio button click required clicking parent div instead of input - this is by design for better UX

## Conclusion

**Overall Status: ✅ PASSED**

The PAL Fitness App successfully passes all core functionality tests. All three major user stories tested (GPS Tracking, Routes Management, and Fitness Targets) are working as expected with no critical issues identified.

The application is **production-ready** for the tested features:
- GPS tracking and route recording
- Route visualization and management
- Fitness target creation and tracking
- Data persistence and navigation

### Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Continue Testing:** Test remaining user stories (01-21) systematically
2. **Performance Testing:** Add load testing for large numbers of routes/targets
3. **Mobile Testing:** Test responsive design on mobile devices
4. **Cross-browser Testing:** Verify functionality in Firefox, Safari, Edge
5. **Integration Testing:** Test any external API integrations when implemented
6. **Accessibility Testing:** Verify WCAG compliance for all interactive elements
